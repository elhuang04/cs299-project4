            <p>The year is 2008. The year before, the first iPhone was released making it the first time the masses could carry access to the world wide web in their pocket. The world is on the cusp of a great expansion of expression and community as never seen before. A thirty year old Richard Spencer had just dropped out of his PhD program at Duke to work for “The American Conservative” magazine—he was fired within the year for views called too extreme (https://abc13.com/richard-spencer-white-supremacist-nationalist-alt-right/2550923/ ). He started “The Alternative RIght” webzine in 2010. Alt-right, popularized by Spencer, is a term describing the far-right, white nationalist ideology. “Alt-right pipeline” is a theory describing the radicalization of individuals towards the alt-right, especially on the internet towards communities such as the one Spencer created. There have been many theories as to whether individuals in certain communities or with certain traits are more likely to participate in this pipeline, of which the online gaming community, specifically gaming content creators on Youtube, are at the forefront of. It has been observed that gaming communities have developed a violent ideology associated with the American alt-right. The Youtube algorithm is often a central blame for this radicalization of young men. Specifically, misinformation seems to have a central role in how people are able to be sucked into the alt-right pipeline. Safiya Noble suggests that a rapid shift toward commercial interests lends to deregulated media. Even more so, the internet spreads this information quickly and without many checks (Noble, 171-172). YouTube’s ad-driven revenue provides a perfect example of this vulnerability, and thus breeding ground for alt-right content.</p>
            <p>2014’s “Gamergate” served as the start of the political split within the gaming community. The movement started as an anti-feminist heckling campaign, building off of the misogyny rampant in many gaming communities. Much of this manifesting as doxxing, death threats, threats of sexual assault, and general harassment of female journalists. However, there was a much deeper and more insidious root to Gamergate beyond sexism: online recruitment from neo-nazi white supremacist groups. Much of this radicalization happened on platforms like 4chan, 8chan, and Voat, which were largely unregulated and fostered quite a few unethical ideologies. 4chan’s “/pol” chatboard specifically appealed to many young men, Milo Yiannopoulo argues, because of the shock value and comedy they find from racist trolling. The conservative radicalization, largely of young white men, has a clear followthrough in the “trolling” behavior of many Trump supporters in the 2016 election, an event marking a distinct political shift in the country (Romano). Kint Finley writes that gamergate was so successful because “It tells them [young white men] that they are the natural rulers of the world, but that they are simultaneously being oppressed by a secret religious order” (Matthews). The left’s push towards racial and gender equality feels like a direct attack to these young white men, making them prime victims for the alt-right movement.</p>
            <p>We are really interested in looking at how platforms like YouTube allow this kind of morally dubious content to occupy its platform in such a central space. Specifically, we are interested in seeing how gamer content contains alt-right language that leads viewers to engage with increasingly radical alt-right content. This is both an epistemic harm to the larger community, as misinformation is being spread unchecked on these platforms, and a tangible harm to marginalized communities. This project is of great importance to us because of the harm this algorithmic injustice is doing to our community, specifically in radicalizing many young men. Through the power of data analysis, we wanted to dive deep into what YouTube algorithm is really doing, and if we can fall down the rabbit hole ourselves.</p>

              This data collection process aims to analyze the presence of alt-right language in gaming-related content on YouTube, exploring possible connections in the content via video transcriptions. The main objective is to understand the overlap of alt-right language usage within these spaces.

              <strong>3.3 Raw Data Profile</strong><br>
              Before beginning data collection, our search term queries and relevant keywords were sourced from 19 sites: 11 for alt-right and 8 for gaming. This provided us with a list of 214 alt-right keywords, 486 gaming keywords, and 112 skip words (commonly used words within these articles that did not significantly contribute to the meaning of a sentence). In our data collection, we were able to query a total of 5860 unique videos within the gaming category. The bulk of the alt-right content used came from 93 queries of the first search result to the keywords in our alt-right keyword list. The relevant data stored from these search results (in both categories of videos – political and gaming) included videoID, channelID, title, description, liveBroadcastContent, channelTitle, publishTime, alt_right_similarity_score, predicted_category.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>3.4 Methodology</strong><br>
              The method we chose to observe the presence of alt-right content in gaming communities on YouTube was primarily through search results. An alternative method we explored to investigate this relationship was probing YouTube’s recommendation system via “Up-Next” videos, A similar study on the observation of political bias on YouTube, for instance, uses the following strategy: using the top 3 search results of political queries to queue recommendations. They use this strategy as “a majority of YouTube users only click on the top 3 results” (Lutz, 2021). In these results and their recommended videos, the paper outlines using BERT to perform sentiment analysis on each video transcript and identify the political affiliation of a given video. With this in mind, we used a similar strategy to observe the gaming community and see how much overlap might exist between sub-categories in gaming videos to alt-right media (top search result of each query). As we know that the algorithm may recommend increasingly more extreme content with each video, our data collection first seeks to understand how much existing alt-right content is contained within videos in the gaming category. The idea is that the observation of a high overlap between the two spheres of media shows a strong correlation between the two types of videos, which in turn might lead to a more likely recommendation of an alt-right video, while very little overlap means that an alt-right video is less likely to lead directly to an alt-right video.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>3.5 Implementation Details</strong><br>
              Using the words sourced from various articles, we first queried 93 alt-right terms in YouTube’s search. We then took just the top search result of each query and stored these results in an alt-right video data frame. Our initial idea for finding gaming videos was a similar method: retrieving the top search results for gaming-related queries. However, we received a more comprehensive list of relevant gaming videos through the gaming category as provided through the YouTube data API. Thus, our data collection mainly consisted of querying the YouTube data API for the top search results in the gaming category over (without prompt/ query provided). Each search result request yielded roughly 300-700 videos of results, all of which were ultimately stored in a larger data frame (duplicates removed to only contain unique videos) of all gaming videos found.
              The biggest limitation of our methodology was the quota limit for API requests, which reduced the size of our data collection pool. To work around this, the code ensures that all data is written to a .csv file even when not all search results can be requested, providing a save point right before the quota limit has been reached. Additionally, we switched our initial implementation of using the same API for retrieving video captions and used a Python package for transcriptions to reduce token usage.

        <h3 onclick="toggleSection(this)">4.1 Summary of Findings (Qualitative & Quantitative Analysis)</h3>
        <p>
          Our analysis finds that gaming videos have an average similarity of 0.584% to alt-right media (see Figure 1). Unsurprisingly, the 5 videos that were scored with the highest alt-right similarity had the most mention of themes of gun violence, rage, and death (Table 1). The sub-category with the highest average similarity score is Strategy Game Tips, which is 4.354% similar (see Figure 2). While the amount of overlap isn’t particularly high, the potential implications of propagating extreme content in the gaming sphere can be especially severe as the average audience members in the gaming community are teens. For instance, in the highest similarity category, Strategy Game Tips, videos comment on games such as Teamfight Tactics and Warhammer 3, both of which are for youth ages 13 and up. Additionally, the single highest similarity score among all the videos was found in the Mobile Game Updates sub-category, with one of its videos reaching 11.666% in similarity (see Figure 3, 4). Beyond these high-similarity sub-categories, Minecraft Hacks stands out as the category with the highest volume of videos in the gaming segment with more than 532 videos in its category, taking up 9.078% of the entire dataset (Figure 5). Between 2019 and 2020, we observed a significant decrease in alt-right similarity scores (Figure 6), which may be attributed to the changes in YouTube's search algorithms at roughly the same timeline. According to YouTube’s Official Blog team, “... in 2019 [YouTube] first began demoting borderline content in recommendations, resulting in a 70% drop in watchtime on non-subscribed, recommended borderline content in the U.S. Today, consumption of borderline content that comes from our recommendations is significantly below 1%” (Goodrow, 2021). These algorithm changes likely influenced gaming content, reducing incidental exposure to alt-right themes across the platform and potentially contributing to the overall drop in similarity scores.

        <p>
          The data analysis process involves several stages aimed at identifying the similarity between gaming videos and alt-right political media. Initially, we use a small number of purely political video transcripts preprocessed to remove any extraneous content. The process for selecting these alt-right content videos is described above in our data collection methodology...

        <p>
          Using the videoID information from the alt-right data frame, we retrieved video transcripts from all search results and combined them into a single document. We then used SpaCy, an NLP library, to extract all words and remove any irrelevant entities as specified in the skip_words.txt file. The content of this was then combined with all the keywords we sourced from articles to form a master list of keywords used as a baseline for alt-right content...

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our observation of the content overlap between gaming videos and alt-right media on YouTube calls attention to the <b>intersection of algorithmic biases and social influence</b>, themes central to both Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein’s <a href="https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/">Data Feminism</a> and Safiya Noble’s <a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/">Algorithms of Oppression</a>. More specifically, our analysis examines the power held by the <b>algorithms designed by YouTube, which influences the content watched by users</b>.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Data Feminism</i>, D’Ignazio and Klein, one principle that strongly relates to our research topic is the idea of <b>examining power</b>. D’Ignazio and Klein argue for a critical examination of how data systems reflect and reinforce existing power dynamics, which is reflected in our observation of YouTube’s recommendation system, which urges users to make uninformed decisions on the platform. A secondary principle observed in our project is <b>plurality</b>; as our objective was to thoroughly probe the platform for content that may exclude more neutral perspectives. Similarly, Noble highlights how search engines and recommendation systems can amplify harmful stereotypes and contribute to the marginalization of certain groups by promoting biased content via “neutral” or “objective” recommendation systems as the ultimate decisions algorithms make are solely based on their designs, which translate human biases into automated/ digital processes. Applying these perspectives in our methodology helped to uncover that YouTube’s algorithm may inadvertently favor or demote certain types of content based on the extremity of its video content (language included in each video transcript).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the content was observed more closely, we were able to find instances of <b>aggressive behavior or wording within these video transcripts</b>, proving the validity of our algorithms. The findings of decreased similarity scores support the idea of favoring alt-right content as we observed the impact of deliberate intervention in post-2019 results, demonstrating the mitigation of extreme content/ biases with intentional algorithmic adjustments.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, both <i>Data Feminism</i> and <i>Algorithms of Oppression</i> underscore the importance of designing algorithms with an awareness of social impact, particularly for communities vulnerable to bias. This study’s findings reinforce that unchecked algorithmic processes can inadvertently lead to the propagation of harmful content. Therefore, a feminist and justice-oriented approach to data analysis and recommendation algorithms is essential for fostering inclusivity and equity within digital spaces.<br>
